# CostComparison
Compares the cost of food purchased at a grocery store verses at a wholesale club.

          Does buying in bulk save money? This project analyzes 10 weeks (May 2022 to August 2022) of grocery receipts from a grocery store and compares the cost of
     groceries over 10 weeks (August 2022 to October 2022) that were purchased in bulk at a wholesale club in addition to a grocery store. The totals are the cost of
     food for a family of 4. With inflation and rising prices, many are looking for ways to save money. It’s clear that buying in bulk can save money, but how much
     does that impact the cost of food overall? Many items can’t be purchased at a wholesale club due to lack or limited availability, but shopping at a wholesale club
     should decrease the money spent at a grocery store. Analyzing the data shows an unexpected and skewed result at first glance. In 2022, the cost of food
     dramatically increased. Some outlets report a mere 12 percent hike. However, based on several items I routinely purchase , the rate of inflation for food is
     closer to 30 percent-and our budget definitely supports this. The information in graph 1 is from earlier in the year when the cost of food was increasing, but it
     was much less than it is now. The difference in cost depicted in the graphs were surprising-we came close to braking even. Turns out, wholesale clubs have such
     great deals, we ended up buying more “specialty” items such as energy drinks. 
     
 
The project is done in Visual Studio Code. The packages needed to run the program are: pandas, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, and numpy (pip install pandas, pip install matplotlib, pip install matplotlib.pyplot, pip install numpy.)
 
The 5 features I have included are:
 
Feature 1: Make a list, dictionary, tuple, or other standard python data structure to read in data for your program. You can do something as easy  as a dictionary that contains 5 key value pairs with information about [*your project.] 
*Assuming this is what was intended, as the sentence was incomplete in the directions. 
 
(Additional) Feature 1: Read in data from a local csv, excel file, json, or any other file type. There are many ways to do this, but using Pandas read_functions is pretty easy. 
 
Feature 2: Use built-in pandas or numpy functions to do things like remove 0’s and null values where they don’t belong in your data set. 
 
Feature 3: Do 5 basic calculations with Pandas, like finding the sum(), median(), mean(), or mode() of a column. You could divide two columns by each other. You could multiply a column by a random integer. You could use string operations and find the most common letter in a given entry. 
 
Feature 4: Make 2 basic plots with matplotlib, seaborn, or any other kind of visualization library that you think looks interesting. 
 
Feature 5: Write markdown cells in Jupyter explaining your thought process and code. If you make a few plots with matplotlib, explain what the reader is seeing and why you chose to plot things that way. 
 
(Additional) Feature 5: If using some other format other than a notebook, make sure your README explains your project.
